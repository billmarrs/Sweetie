# Sweetie

This is meant to be a simulation of my beloved cat.

It's a simple Cordova app that uses Phaser.io.  It is based off the "cordova-phaser" template (https://github.com/amex4152/cordova-phaser).  

To build:
o Clone Sweetie repro into a directory.
o Get a copy of phaser.min.js (I've been using https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce v2.8.2).
o Place phaser.min.js in www/js
o Install Cordova if you haven't already.
o "cordova prepare" to set things up (will install requirements)
o "cordova run browser" to see a local in-browser version of the app (meow).

I've built and tested this on ios and Android 6.0.1.
